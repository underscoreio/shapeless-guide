## Recap: algebraic data types

*Algebraic data types* (*ADTs*[^adts])
are a functional programming concept
with a fancy name but a very simple meaning.
They are simply an idiomatic way of representing data
using "ands" and "ors". For example:

 - a shape is a rectangle **or** a circle
 - a rectangle has a width **and** a height
 - a circle has a radius

[^adts]: Be careful not to confuse
algebraic data types with "abstract data types",
which are a different modelling tool
with little bearing on the discussion here.

In ADT terminology,
"and" types such as rectangle and circle are called *products*,
and "or" types such as shape are called *coproducts*.
In Scala we typically represent products using
case classes and coproducts using sealed traits:

```tut:book:silent
sealed trait Shape
final case class Rectangle(width: Double, height: Double) extends Shape
final case class Circle(radius: Double) extends Shape

val rect: Shape = Rectangle(3.0, 4.0)
val circ: Shape = Circle(1.0)
```

The beauty of ADTs is that they are completely type safe.
The compiler has complete knowledge of the algebras we define,
so it can support us in writing complete,
correctly typed methods involving our types:

```tut:book:silent
def area(shape: Shape): Double =
  shape match {
    case Rectangle(w, h) => w * h
    case Circle(r)       => math.Pi * r * r
  }
```

```tut:book
area(rect)
area(circ)
```

### Alternative encodings

Sealed traits and case classes are undoubtedly
the most convenient encoding of ADTs in Scala.
However, they aren't the *only* encoding.
For example, the Scala standard library provides
generic products in the form of `Tuples`
and a generic coproduct in the form of `Either`.
We could have chosen these to encode our `Shape`:

```tut:book:silent
type Rectangle2 = (Double, Double)
type Circle2    = Double
type Shape2     = Either[Rectangle2, Circle2]

val rect2: Shape2 = Left((3.0, 4.0))
val circ2: Shape2 = Right(1.0)
```

While this encoding is less readable than the case class encoding above,
it does have some of the same desirable properties.
We can still write completely type safe operations involving `Shape2`:

```tut:book:silent
def area2(shape: Shape2): Double =
  shape match {
    case Left((w, h)) => w * h
    case Right(r)     => math.Pi * r * r
  }
```

```tut:book
area2(rect2)
area2(circ2)
```

Importantly, `Shape2` is a more *generic* encoding than `Shape`[^generic].
Any code that operates on a pair of `Doubles`
will be able to operate on a `Rectangle2` and vice versa.
As Scala developers we tend to see interoperability as a bad thing:
what havoc will we accidentally wreak across our codebase with such freedom?! (MS: raises eyebrows)
However, in some cases it is a desirable feature.
For example, if we're serializing data to disk,
we don't care about the difference
between a pair of `Doubles` and a `Rectangle2`.
Just write or read two numbers and we're done.

shapeless gives us the best of both worlds:
we can use friendly sealed traits and case classes by default,
and switch to generic representations when we want interoperability
(more on this later).
However, instead of using `Tuples` and `Either`,
shapeless uses its own data types to represent
generic products and coproducts.
We'll introduce to these types in the next sections.

[^generic]: We're using "generic" with an informal way here,
not the formal meaning of "a type with a type parameter".
